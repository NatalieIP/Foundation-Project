<h1>The Formative Years</h1>
<body>
<p class = "common">A lot of experiences have shaped who I am today, however there are few that I can remember till date. My family is very musical, so I attribute the majority of my musical ability to the 
influential stylings of my Dad.
</p>

  <h2>Memories</h2>  
  <p class="common">When I was young my siblings and I would record over my Dad's Ebenezer Obey & <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Green">Al Green</a> cassette tapes for fun - 
    we got into a lot of trouble.</p>
